Welcome to the fancy picture frame! Crafted by Jack!

Feel free to copy this guide to your computer for future reference. :D

Controls:
Button 1 picks a random picture uploaded to this picture frame.
Button 2 enables USB connectivity mode.
Button 3 picks a random picture from the internet. Namely, a website called "Unsplash".

How to add pictures to this picture frame:
Drag and drop any PNG and JPG into this folder.
Make sure the image is a reasonable file size, and has the dimensions of 800 x 480px. I recommend https://squoosh.app as a convenient online tool to resize and convert images. There is also Microsoft PowerToys, which can let you resize in bulk all in one go!
Then when you have uploaded all of your pictures unmount this device safely, and press Button 1 again. That will disable USB connectivity and load a random picture.

To change the WiFi, create a wifi.txt file in this folder. On the first line, put your WiFi SSID (name) and on the second line put your WiFi password. Pressing button 1 will also prompt the device to read the WiFi credentials.
